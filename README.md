# Food_delivery_time_prediction
Machine_Learning_Programming Final Project
 
Food delivery services like Zomato and Swiggy strive to provide accurate estimates of delivery times to their customers. Predicting delivery times accurately is crucial for ensuring customer satisfaction and optimizing delivery operations. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to predict food delivery times based on various factors such as the age of the delivery partner, ratings of previous deliveries, and total distance.
 
## About
 
This project aims to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be utilized to predict food delivery times accurately. By analyzing historical data and training predictive models, we can estimate the time it will take for a food delivery order to reach its destination. The models developed in this project can be integrated into food delivery platforms to enhance the user experience and streamline delivery operations.
